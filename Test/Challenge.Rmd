## Overview

In this workshop, we introduce you to R and RStudio at the beginner level. This condensed __2-hour workshop__ is meant to get you started in R and acts as a pre-requisite for our more advanced workshops. In it, we cover:

* R and RStudio
    + RStudio projects
    + R scripts
    + Installing packages
* Reading in data as a data frame
* Vectors, single values, and data types
* Basic data visualization
* The help function

We will do all our work in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio is an integrated development and analysis environment for R that brings a number of conveniences over using R in a terminal or other editing environments. You should have both R and RStudio installed, as described in the [setup instructions](http://asda.stat.ubc.ca/workshops/2019-02_Ecoscope_reproducible/setup.html).

## A Tour of RStudio
When you start RStudio, you will see something like the following window appear:

## Getting Started
###Loading data into an R dataframe
We will store the data as an _object_ named `dat` using the assignment operator <-, so that we can re-use it in our analysis.

``` {r dat, echo=TRUE}
# read the data and save it as an object

dat <- read.table(file="data.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
Now we can refer to the data frame as `dat` like so.
``` {r dat2, echo = TRUE}
dat
```
